"Alappuzha-Changanassery road was constructed in 1955 during the time of Thiru-Kochi Rajapramukhan Sri Chithira Tirunal Balaramavarma. Pattam Thanupillai was the Chief Minister of Thiru-Kochi. The progress made by connecting the then major port town of Alappuzha and Central Kerala's main trading center Changanassery through Kuttanad by land was studied (1954 Kuttanad Development Scheme [Kuttanad Development Scheme] Study Report). All the people of Kuttanad supported the new road initiative. Many people lost their places due to this but generally no one objected to it. AC, the first road in Kuttanad. The initial work on the road started from Kaitavana in Alappuzha. Today this area is commonly known as Kalarkot.

The elevation of Kuttanad ranges from 2.2 m below sea level to 0.6 m above sea level. Road construction in Kuttanad below sea level was difficult. After taking the swampy soil (mud) of Kuttanad from one side and cutting the road parallel to the other side, the work started targeting Changanassery. The road work started from Kaitavana in Alappuzha and reached the eastern side of Mampuzha without any major problems. If you take the road ahead in this direction, instead of Changanassery, Muthoot MC near Thiruvalla. That's when you realize that it will be on the road. Therefore, the direction of the road from Mampuzhakari was changed slightly to the north and M.C. at Perunna. Also brought on the road. Due to this, A.C. This is the main bend in the road (core curve). A new river was formed on the south side parallel to the road made by taking mud from one side and putting it on the other side. It was named Puthanaar, which means new. A.C. The road runs parallel to the Puthanar road from Manakkachira in Changanassery to Kaitavana in Alappuzha.

In 1957, eleven bridges were completed by A.C. The road was opened to the public. It was one of the first roads in New Kerala. But even then the work of three big bridges could not be completed.[3] Many years later, the trench bridge over Manimalayat was completed. Again many years later, during the Chief Ministership of EK Nayanar, the Nedumudi and Pallathurthi bridges over the Pampanadi were completed and opened to the public on the same day. Alappuzha - Changanassery road was the first road to be built bisecting Kuttanadu. A.C. The transport revolution initiated by the advent of the road helped both Kuttanad and Alappuzha to progress.[4]",1

It's funny that a BJP supporter is preaching about religious harmony. You say, what kind of work related to financial statement closure should be done on Easter day or can be done on the same day? Even if that's the argument, they could let people in the financial department work, but they canceled leave on Easter day, how could you think it's reasonable. My question is relevant: if they were so concerned about the financial year ending, why didn't they? Do they do the same on Holi? Also, the new financial year isn't ending just for Manipur but for the whole of India, mate. I still wonder what kind of activities they are so eager to complete on that particular day.",1

During day time this purchase could be made at the rate of almost 3 rupees per unit. Solar power comes during this time of the day and Rs.2.60 to consumer is reasonable. During night a part is managed by the hydel projects and the rest is met by purchasing power almost at the rate of Rs. 12 per unit. Its an unfair advantage to those who have installed solar. This decision is actually a fair one.",1

"Kerala has achieved superiority over developed countries in dealing with Covid. It was noticed and referred to all over the world. Among the special mentions of international agencies.
But, as usual, only the people of Kerala have a misfortune like no other place in the world. A powerful faction in its own country that is capable of defeating its own people! It was by directly defeating that class that Kerala took a step which is seen today and which people like Amartyasen assess to be on par with the developed countries.

It has been almost seven decades since Kerala's 'internal enemies' started this work. Any student who studies the seven decades of modern Kerala from then till now can find them on every side of any effort to bring about social change and upliftment of the grassroots! Naturally, the mainstream media, which started under the ownership of the land grabbers, continues to give them direction and 'made up stories' along with them.",1
Very true,1
A gentleman with proper knowledge about Kerala and the world. A man who is knowledgeable about many countries and recognizes the freedom of people Indiansï¿½.,1

"No investment is coming to Kerala, no industry is coming but the people of the state who say they are coming, are coming to work in Kerala, earning money from working in Kerala and sending money to their state, their family is living comfortably there and they are also living comfortably in Kerala.",1

"It was not a political speech by the Union Minister but it was exposing the current situation of Kerala, the situation is very pathetic",0
The first reason for the absence of large industries in Kerala is the situation here. Tourism is the most likely source of income in Kerala.,1

100% correct. Kerala still has a long way to go in this regard.,0

"Niagra is the name of a building, which had opened up in technopark phase 3. It's a facility in the IT sector and not an industry.

Keralam exceeding all the limits fixed by financial commission. Other states will also come with same demand if it allows.,0
I feel that this is a new beginning to take an approach that takes into consideration the needs of the state along with maintaining the economic stability of the country.,1

"Even if it is late, this is a good sign that the truth is in your mind",1
I understand that there are people who know the truth in the church.. They know that there will be those who will see your Christian love in this election result.... BJP should remember that not all church leaders are traitors like PC George and Kennedy...,1

Why is the relationship between BJP and JPU not included in this?,0
ED and BD are a team that trembles to touchğŸ˜® but if this family is included then Kerala will be savedğŸ˜Š,0
Nothing will happen. Look. Two seats in the election or a good amount of electricity bond or both for BJP. It will be there. Neither the ED nor the central government can touch Pinarayi's hair. Those who are born with enough talent should see it. Porat drama is performed to throw dust in people's eyes. Nothing else. ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚,0

Ed is playing with notices. Isaac is not responding to the notice because he knows very well that this game will continue till the election is over.,0

Tirutha Thoma and Bond Thoma in the same party. Best poti chor party.,0
Most likely the scientist will be picked up by ED,0
"If present, the squirrel is inside",0
There are so many notices,0
Is it right that the world's greatest economist should be humiliated by an ED notice like this? No one in the world has even heard of the names of Saipin that he mentions. He should be given the Nobel Prize for collecting ropes to improve the economic situation. Ha what can be done beyond Modi.,0
"What did Isaac not produce? Why are you afraid? If an investigating agency summons someone legally, don't go. I am not calling to arrest. Don't challenge the legal system",0
"Malayalees generate a tax income of 1 lakh 175,000 crores per year to the Kerala government. Malayalees pay tax on everything from salt to camphor. Kerala government has more responsibility to provide jobs to Malayalees. Kerala is going to collapse due to mismanagement. When the public debt increases, there will be an increase in prices only in Kerala. When the public debt of Kerala increases, the price increase will increase. The first thing to come in Kerala is a huge price increase. When Vijayan came in 2016, the public debt was one and a half lakh crores in 7 years and an additional 4 lakh crores in 7 years ğŸ˜ğŸ˜ğŸ˜ Kerala will become the worst state in India in 15 years Kerala will become the most expensive state in India. It is already a complete consumer state ğŸ˜ğŸ˜Keralites especially Semitic people (more than 50%) should ignore BJP.Kerala will become the worst state in India in 15 years ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜„ğŸ˜„ğŸ˜ğŸ˜Then learn. In the rest of the BJP-ruled states, everything is a double-engine government and up to the development, the state government and the central government will contribute ğŸ˜ğŸ˜Kerala will make all the projects implemented by the center in its name. Everything, including the life house scheme, including the ration shop, including distribution of midday meal, has the share of the Centre. But no one will say anything because the Antamkammis are gangsters. In Kerala, 60 lakh people have gone abroad as expatriates. Four or five people in the country live on the money that each one sends. 60 lakh good four two and a half crore people. Rest of the government officials.. 4 or 5 people live in the country depending on each and every one of them. There are no industrial establishments or employment opportunities in our Kerala. You can live in Kerala only by doing wage labor or in poverty. Being a Keralite is nothing to be proud of. The Malayalis themselves go to work in Bombay, Gujarat, Bangalore, Chennai and Delhi. There is nothing left in the hands of the Kerala government except to pay salaries and pensions to the Kerala state government employees. ğŸ˜ Ration shop, school children get porridge, job guarantee and life housing scheme are all because of the center. Look at the condition of panchayat roads it is the duty of kerala govt, everything is dilapidated ğŸ˜ in 15 years kerala will become the worst state in india. The Center will not look back because the people here did not defeat the BJP. Everything is progressing in other states. In the past, only men did not have the right to live in Kerala. In the coming times, we can live only if women also leave the country and become expatriates ğŸ˜ğŸ˜ğŸ˜®ğŸ˜®ğŸ˜®ğŸ˜®",0
"1600 rupees welfare pension is never paid monthly it is paid in arrears for three to four months. It also has a central share. Kerala is running the Pradhan Mantri Ayushman Bharat Rs 5 lakh medical scheme. The central government is responsible for the employment guarantee scheme, getting a house under the life housing scheme and giving goods in the ration shop. Why is the central government even providing midday meals in schools? Central allocation is available for everything. 60% of the total revenue of the Kerala government goes towards the salary pension of the government employees. About 37 percent of the public debt will go towards paying its interest. The remaining three percent is the development of the scam. To tell the truth, the Kerala government does not have a surplus of 10000 crore rupees to spend in this state in a year ğŸ˜. No one knows that Kerala is a poor state. Now this is Bengal, this is the truth. Kerala's only hope is to raise its GDP by increasing production and setting up factories like in Tamil Nadu. Even if Yesudas, not Mohanlal, is kept as a BJP person, Christians and Muslims will not win the BJP because of religious animosity. In Kerala, it is the Christians and Muslims who are spreading the opposition to the BJP to the Hindus. The religious sentiments of the religious people are the only reason for the opposition to the BJP. Then there are also the communists. Unlike other states, Kerala has 50 percent religious people. So the central government will not show much interest in saving Kerala. Kerala is the state with the highest petrol prices in India. When compared to many states in India, there is a difference of up to 12 rupees per liter of petrol in Kerala. Kerala is passing because of expatriates who have been sentenced to 25 years of life imprisonment. If petrol runs out and the Gulf era ends, Kerala will become Somalia. Do you know the misery of expatriates? Still, those expatriates will write Kerala number one while lying there. The public debt should mostly pay interest. Yet among these, the biggest burden is increasing the salary and pension of government officials. About 60% of Kerala exchequer is used to pay salary and pension to government employees. At present, the annual expenditure is about 75,000 crore rupees. The total income is â‚¹1,75,000 crore. Then 39% has to be paid interest on the public debt. And the total three percent amount is less than 10000 crores which can be used for the development of KeralağŸ˜„ğŸ˜®ğŸ˜®ğŸ˜¢ğŸ˜¢ğŸ˜¢ğŸ˜¢ğŸ˜¢",0

Surendran says that in SFI colleges, there is a dungeon (? ).
Locals say that there is no study in the college. Drugs, debate about free sex, toddy, teaching to wear veil, these are all seen in the videos. University/Government should bring out the truth about this.

It started before the election,0
The central government's argument was that Kerala does not have to pay even a single rupee for rice procurement. But the central government's decision to allow the arrears is an admission that this argument is wrong. The government has sanctioned Rs 852.29 crore for the five-year arrears till 2021. 756.24 crore rupees is yet to be paid by the central government to the state in good storage share of paddy,0

Now file the case without waiting for the court to intervene.",0
This is not suitable for a leader.,0

Looks like BJP will come here sooner than expected if the chief has longevity!!!,0

Does the door open if the dog barks?,0
Blame the central government for this matter. Showing communalism for four votes..,0
This should be questioned in the court.. Don't condone the people who are trying to get votes by misleading people like this..,0
The Chief Minister only knows how to say racism!,0
He is an illiterate person. Don't expect more from him.,0
"This body that was silent when I called Avi, Malar and Kunthirika to take care of me... is he human.... what a pity ğŸ˜¢.ğŸ˜¢

Is he eating human waist?,0
No one who has ruled Kerala by destroying it and fostering communalism has done anything like this,0
Pinarayi has only the good intention of instilling fear among the Muslim masses and pretending to be their savior and get votes. Ministers should decide in which way the CAA will not be implemented. Don't just create a smokescreen and get away with it.,0

Can a chief minister speak against the Indian law.... can he create religious hatred,0
The Kerala Marxists are not ignorant of the treatment of China Ugair Muslims in Chung. CAA Mahascharyam we also need to get the vote only so much. Let's wait and see how long the Marxists will continue to take advantage of the insecurity among Muslims ğŸ˜œ,0
Time has come to bring him in with Kejriwal,0
He is going against this country and center... He made this place a dangerous area since last so many years with the help of his terrorist group... Not to allow him freely travel this way and send to lock up,0
What will you do if you are weak due to lack of information and become pregnant due to lack of knowledge?,0

"In Kerala, the Chief Minister is doing an act of beating the people by telling such news",0
"Damn, are the common people of Kerala carrying this burden to suffer so much sin?",0
In his name. A case should be filed against Andyumpal for creating religious tension - rioting. The law of the land also applies to him.,0

So they don't know what is written in the bill. IN THIS BILL NO MUSLIMS IN OUR COUNTRY WILL NOT HAVE ANY CONNECTION. THIS BILL IS FOR THE PEOPLE WHO CAME TO OUR COUNTRY FROM PAKISTAN AND AFGHANISTAN BY ATTACKING HINDUS, CHRISTIANS, SICK AND JAIN FROM THIS COUNTRY. THEY FORCED TO COME BACK OUR COUNTRY. OUR MUSLIM BROTHERS THIS IS THE BILL. BILL IS NOT AGAINST ANY MUSLIMS. PLEASE UNDERSTAND.",0
That is why the chief is placed in the chair to stir up communalism,0
Misguiding the Muslim community,0
He and the CPM party are criminals,0

I think he is out of his mind...,0
A case should be filed against him for sedition and sedition,0
It is important to see how the Election Commission views what has been said in the event that the election has been announced,0
He is trying to unite all Hindus,0
"It is not enough that this man is caught and thrown out for this reason, it will be difficult for the children of other religions who are going to be born poor to live, so he should be brought down and sent to jail.",0
Everyone should sit in their proper position or else such people would have come in and said that they are drowned ministers.,0
The biggest communalist in Kerala says that BJP is a communal party,0
Don't throw stones at a crazy dog.It will get angry. In the end it will be some deficit religionist who gets bitten.,0
Our legal system says what action should be taken when those responsible make such irresponsible statements. So what?,0
"No matter what he has done, is there no political leadership in India to lock him up?",0

"Just to create hatreds, divisions and unrest
Commis low standard gimmicks ,Dirty appeasement

A slave party is a party that does not hesitate to do anything for four votes,0
In parliament election we should not vote for the parties which support hamas organization in India,0
"By general society, not gangs",0
To become the Chief Minister in this party without anyone with knowledge and education,0
We also applied for this. But later it was rejected. But they are still calling,0
This is not fair,0
He was caught in the center and people understood his fraud to create classism.,0
The reason for the vote is because this informer is dead,0
All those LDF candidates who may get through in the ensuing Lok Sabha election will be disqualified based on this anti national and inflammatory speech by the CM. UDF candidates must also be careful while referring to CAA during canvassing.,0

"Hasn't the general public started to understand that Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan is the leader of the banned PFI activists in Kerala? Pinarayi Vijayan is the leader of Islamic terrorism. Vijayan, who is now the Chief Minister, signed a party membership of CPM and the position of Chief Minister just so that the general public does not recognize this. The PFI terrorist is the one who made tea in Kerala. Central agencies NIA should keep a close watch on his activities. CPIM's Chief Minister post is just a smoke screen. People of Kerala should act cautiously in the upcoming elections. Otherwise the people of Kerala who are arrogant and arrogant will have to sacrifice their own lives. Remember, everyone needs religion and faith. People who are impartial and free from religious fanaticism should understand that the present is in very great danger and should not forget that the danger is right next to us.",0
Even the Chief Minister is running through the veins,0
They will spew racial venom and then say secular,0
Kerala Muslims get easily persuaded by all these propagandas,0
A chief minister should not have talked like this it's completely condemnable,0
Save our nation from Marxism and associated alliances,0
"Aren't they now Bantus? If you criticize your relative, your daughter's future is not precious to every father. What every father wants is the well-being of his children. There is no problem in it. There are fathers who have shown selfishness for their children and those who have fallen into traps.",0
Pinarayi Vijayan's decadent election tactics... Don't think that the Muslim community will believe the words of this scoundrel... Just see them as the decadent jalpanas of a wretched birth that seeks to rule the people of Kerala as slaves of Jihadis.... This Pinarayi Vijayan is a black chapter in the history of Kerala. .,0
"Stupid people should suffer, still vote for them and win hellish sufferings anubhavikku",0

Is this Pinu an idiot? He will stoop to any level for votes. He is always reading out prepared notes. Doesn't he understand what he is reading out? He is desperate to get some LS seats to keep the party going.,0
He is a real racist,0
It's a pity that he's so sad,0
CPM is creating riots in Kerala,0
Can you change ON Grid to Off Grid?,0
He will fall on his head,0
Why can't BJP go to court against his allegation?,0
Why don't the police file a case against the CM for inciting religious sentiments. He will set religious fire in Kerala before he goes to jail....Psychopath ğŸ˜¢,0
There is no action for this... to whom to complain,0
Vijayan destroyed the Communist Party,0
No one in this country has the backbone to replace someone who is so troublesome.,0
It means people leaving in Malappuram are uneducated. They may be living in North Korea.,0
A Jana Sabha should be held to remove the fear of Muslim sect here,0
"Muslims don't trust him, he is a traitor, if you trust him, everyone will be inside ğŸ˜ ğŸ˜ ğŸ˜ ",0
A responsible person should never talk like this. Very bad. The set back for such irresponsible statement from the people will be very hard.,0
"Viewing it as unconstitutional, it is a civil rights act. It is the responsibility to implement it. It is not against the citizens of India, but for those who have migrated from abroad and are living here illegally. This is the law in this world.",0
The Chief Minister made a statement which created separatism among the Muslim community in Kerala.,0
We don't want this foreign party. What is needed is a party born in India.,0
"What is new in this, expect the same from this Nari....",0
Muslims are the shovels in the hands of Pinarayi.,0
"There is a law in the country to take strict action against anyone who tries to mislead the people and spread fear among the people by misinterpreting a law while in power.
A Chief Minister cannot speak at all levels like a political leader. Under the National Security Act, the Central Government and the Supreme Court can take action on such occasions.",0
"This is what is happening in Muslim homes, those who are going to get votes, Center will not take any legal action in Kerala, CPM BJP alliance is proof of this.",0
Get rid of the woodpecker so soon. This is a danger to the country ğŸ˜¡ğŸ˜¡ğŸ˜¡,0
Is he a supporter of ISIS?,0
The time for him to go to jail is over,0
The Chief should remember that Hindus who are Communist sympathizers will also listen to this speech.,0
CPM has become the biggest fascist party in India and survives only by misleading own party cadre and common man. They want the votes only and never really care about any community in particular. Countdown started for the last days of CPM and a Dictatorship. CPI will survive not CPM.,0
There are few people who read the news in Janam TV,0
CM should not be a terrorist,0
"You and Pinarayi Vijayan are almost one and the same. The wild thief Vijayan plundered entire Kerala and Modi can't even touch a single hair of him. Modi govt and BJP have no energy to jail this wild thief Vijayan. Alas, all love for Modi is disappearing because of this Vijayan.",0
He is in a deep state and if he gets the whole country burnt he can escape that is one of it....,0
What is the situation if the Chief Minister who knows everything calls out like this? It is only to mislead the Muslim brothers. E drama. He said that he should not say anything for the sake of four votes.,0
Communism is against democracy,0
"Let Vijayan continue to inflame Islamic communalism like this, nothing more needs to be done to make people think in favor of BJP.",0
"The reason BJP is not winning here is because Pinu has not been brought in with proof yet. People harbor resentment.
Also causes denial of vote.",0
Muslim brothers and sisters are so stupid to believe the main bad advice.,0
So it is not the Malayalee Prabhuddha who can be enlightened forty times at this hour.,0
"BJP Malappuram district leader K.K., who complained to the Central Election Commission. Congratulations to Surendran ğŸ§¡ğŸ§¡ğŸ§¡ğŸ§¡ğŸ§¡. BJP should have done this earlier. When such issues came up earlier, the BJP just sat there pretending not to have seen or heard them, so they still dare to stay here in Kerala and indulge in anti-Hinduism and Jihadi terrorism. Don't allow it anymore. And people should not say Muslim brothers on TV... just say sect. Do you call those who killed our Hindu brothers in Malabar and Marad brothers? ğŸ˜¡ğŸ˜¡ğŸ˜¡ğŸ˜¡ğŸ˜¡ğŸ˜¡ Janam T.V",0
Pinarayi Vijayan is making up for the lack of Mdani in Kerala? The PFI leaders sitting in the cliff house and sitting in the cliff house is a terrible situation!,0
It is good for the Muslim people to know that he is showing such caution only for his survival. What will be the fate of the country if the rest also have such a spirit. It is better for the people if they don't hold his breath.,0
Does anyone know why these types of speeches are not a violation of election code of conduct??? Isn't it clear that election code of conduct is a partisan activity????,0
That is the problem. Will read what is written. I don't know anything beyond that.,0
"You know, the health minister wears make-up, praises the chief, and lies when he opens his mouth.. In the meantime, he doesn't have time to look at your business. Apart from this, nothing is going to happen with them.",0

What is not good about the deficits?,0
He reads what someone writes ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚Yes he knows,0
"When they say citizenship to non-Muslims, it is the religious fanaticism of the dunghills",0
"Yes, he is MAKING religious unrest in Kerala with such statements.",0
Take it and make it Manipur here,0
Oh this Manipur won't stop no matter how much I say ğŸ¤­ğŸ¤­,0
Do we have to prove citizenship?,0
Pakistan's work has been undertaken. Salary and bonus. All these are given by the terroristsâ€¦ That is why the Indian people are fighting each otherâ€¦.,0
It doesn't seem like it will be long before we see the palaces made of dirt crumble in the face of truth.,0
In this way the chief will have to speak till death otherwise the Murians will handle it. Scared ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚,0
The next symbol of CPM is the tree.,0
Let the center rest in peace,0
BJP should file suit in SC nd this very well amount to violation of election rules ..kizhangan paranaariğŸ˜‚,0
"It would be better if the Hindus thought about it. No Hindu should vote for CPM. If you want, you can give it to Muslim League candidates.",0
The time to be chained is over..:. The chief has changed his religion and has taken the form of a terrorist.,0
He may be thinking to make trouble among people by misleading the matter.,0
What will you do if it is so.,0
"This is a way for BJP to win in Kerala. You don't have to say anything about Modi's development here. Here they are going forward by making remarks that divide Hindus and Muslims. In this election, the issue of citizenship is a campaign. Only if BJP moves forward by creating question and answer platforms from the public, Muslims are being hunted here. When it is said that when such a story is spread here, ordinary Hindus and Christians can only stand with the Muslims. Therefore, question and answer forums should be organized at the intersections across Kerala, focusing on the people, focusing on citizenship. This is the only solution.",0
There is no need to lie down and moan when the story of the party relatives who made the paper companies took advantage of the situation and gave tacit permission to lick the import commission.,0
The crying of those who abused Oommen Chandy to the utmost ğŸ˜‚,0
Shailajak is just an image created by CPM's PR work. Shailajak's approach is the same as covering the entire corruption of the CPM and the government.,0
"Escape is always escape. If you see his tree, you will know that he is a world leaderğŸ§Ÿ",0
LDF started with the smell of defeat in Vadakara ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚,0
They will make many complaints that the CPM will surely lose,0
It was not enough to not commit corruption,0
"During the covid-19 pandemic, the PP kit was available for only Rs 500 in the market and the documents show that Shailaja said in the assembly that she bought this kit for Rs 1500. In it, it was said that she paid more than Rs 1000 for a PP kit and Vijayan also knew about it.",0
Why are you so scared? What cyber attack was done against Oommen Chandy?,0
Didn't Pinarayi win the Kerala government by defaming Oommen Chandy sir and murdering him?,0
"There's nothing wrong with telling what happened, but it's not what happened anyway",0
"The fabric should be smooth. The kit was bought at that high price when it was in short supply. At that time the Congress ruled Madhya Pradesh paid over Rs 2000 for the PPE kit. When Shailaja teacher herself explained this, the UDF leaders kept their mouths shut. And then when the election is held, it is released again through social media with the rank and file.",0

Why does CPM get mad when talking about Shailaja's corruption during covid ğŸ˜‚,0
"What can be said about the insults that arise when defeat is faced by those who have made fraud and embezzlement a regular job, but what can be said other than the intolerance that arises when it is exposed in public.",0
Want to know more about how each party is able to touch on the Easter holiday?,0
Together with his daughter. But when will it happen??,0
"Shailaja, who says she is a teacher, did not say anything about this? Every vote given to them is a support for sfi atrocities like this..we should not be responsible for these deaths",0
Badly portraying a teacher who drowned during the covid period and now accepted the fake role of the world is doing a good job ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚,0

The people's government led the youth to strike on the streets for 50 days for a job,0
The central government's argument was that Kerala does not have to pay even a single rupee for rice procurement. But the central government's decision to allow the arrears is an admission that this argument is wrong. The government has sanctioned Rs 852.29 crore for the five-year arrears till 2021. 756.24 crore rupees is yet to be paid by the central government to the state in good storage share of paddy.,0
Don't trust this nonsense in life.,0
People of Kerala have not seen why they feel pain when talking about what happened,0
"Today, the people know the truth that Kovid Kalli was held back by PR work. Crores were exchanged.",0
Christians should not vote for BJP under any circumstances. BJP is communalist. They are enemies of Indian people.,0

What is this ED? Even this indiscriminate woman needs legal advice if she wants to question Pillai. I laugh after listening.,0
Why legal advice to give notice? It cannot be because she is the chief's daughter,0

I agree his point but disagree with off grid .always go for grid since in grid we get subsidy & no battery investment so investment is half .instead go for hybrid we need kseb but keep grid low capacity so if bill is â‚¹ 5000 keep a grid with subsidy 2kw or 3 kw and save 3-4000 remaining â‚¹1000 pay kseb. Dont expect any payback even if they pay its very low rate â‚¹2-3 from government no use. but can reduce your large bill slab. But govt do give subsidy 50-80thoudand utilize same both central & state .battery will need to replace after 5 yr. So again huge investment.intead go for a small inverter with just 2 batteries for non kseb time. while if solar grid had any complaint we have kseb .we should go hybrid,0

"Look at the time of generation of electricity in solar and the cost at that time, the cost at that time is very low. But Gargika consumers consume electricity collectively from 6 pm to 11 pm. At that time the market price of electricity was very high and was around Rs.15 per unit. This will cause huge loss to KSEB. This loss will be borne by the poor consumers who have not installed Bolar as it is now. Therefore net metering should be changed as soon as possible and gross metering should be implemented.

Even if more comes, it has not yet come to more than 5% of the bill when there was no solar. Here is the capitalist system and there is the government of the poor in enlightened Kerala? And don't pay lakhs of monthly salary to KSEB teachers who have not passed 10th class. Then how can we enlightened people not experience this",0
"Friend solar panel production is done during the day. So adding it off-grid would require large battery storage for nighttime use. As the life of the battery decreases it becomes useless.

"The attractiveness of net-metering has led to people including myself taking out loans to set up on-grid solar power plants and buy electric cars. Stopping net metering after people have installed on-grid solar power plants with subsidies and advertisements will adversely affect the credibility of the government and the regulatory commission.

The lines from Sri Narayana Guru's world-revered poem Dattapaharam are relevant here. The Guru has said that ""it is not in vain that the giving of a gift is intoxicating to the family, but remember that it is true as much as the Puragiri"" means, if what is given is taken back, not only the recipient will be sad, but also his family members, this proverb is not meaningless, it is so true that one should remember this. Don't commit that sin...

Therefore, domestic customers who currently have on-grid solar power plants installed should be allowed to continue with net metering.

If it will be gross metering from 01-04-2024, then those who are going to set up on-grid solar power plant may agree to gross metering if they want. Because they are ready for it because they have evaluated its profit and loss.

Those who put solar on-grid can form an organization and go to the High Court. Me too. gone,0

"In Kerala, on-grid solar system is not very practical. In a line where power fails several times a day, especially during the day, none of that time can be transmitted and the solar power is wasted. An off-grid system involving a battery is relatively practical here. The additional cost of the battery can be recouped in the long run by using the solar power sold to kseb at low cost for its own needs,/by avoiding the board's expensive or marginal use.",0

"In that case, the order of the Regulatory Commission that the right to generate power belongs to the government will come soon.",0
Now solar installers have to do the wiring to get away with this scam,0
"More power consumption comes from A/c, Motors, Fridge, Fan, Iron box, water heater..... There will be no big change in KSEB bill if only light bulb is lit....... Similarly, in PMSURYA GHAR MNRE scheme if Ongrid does anything Is there a change?",0
"People should go to the honorable court against this cheating. I installed solar panels, but never received any subsidy.",0
"We can buy it in cash and use it ourselves, why the permission of the government?",0
Get rid of this KSEB and make it private like in Delhi. Give it to 2 agencies. It will be a competition between them. The rate will also decrease. I hope this rule will end soon.,0
"Wild animals kill the poor man, those who struggle after losing their livelihood and bed are framed and remanded in false cases, investigations by central agencies, get nowhere, and then, is this it?",0
And so of the solar scandal. Second part. Super .Those who put solar panel can't take it and throw it away ..another decent scam by govt .,0
Despite all this why Kerala still has such a government... Are Malayalees the biggest fools on planet Earth... One single idiot has taken the whole state at ransom... Pathetic...,0
Deleting kseb without deleting Ldf is useless.,0
"Yes, the current situation would have been the same if there was only mobile phone network bsnl",0
There is no other connection except Kseb in Kerala right now? It is said that soon other electricity distribution companies will also come as part of the center. Let's hope...,0

We need more electricity at night. The only recourse then is the energy stored in the battery.,0
"Against this, this solar company should go to court immediately. Yesterday, the organization had a discussion with the regulatory authority.

Again at the service center they charged me many times till the end of the gurantee period and frauds such as battery change, no sun. I gave it to a pvt company, they said go and buy another panel for 2000 rupees. Bought it and it was gone. Now the third panel. Even if technology changes, this is the situation of solar panel, 5-6 years is fine, rest is like luck.

I am an electricity consumer who has fitted solar electricity generation system to grid. With respect to the above reference, I strongly requested the Kerala Electricity Regulatory Commission not to accept the new proposal of gross billing system put forward by KSEB for solar electricity consumers for the following genuine reasons.

1) India is a country with good solar light throughout the year and hence almost all states of India are going to solar electricity to use green solar energy to produce electricity to protect our atmosphere for us and for the future generations.

2) Further different state governments and the central government are giving subsidy for encouraging and continuously motivating the electricity consumers to go for solar in the larger interest of the country to preserve the atmosphere (by stopping coal and naphtha plants in a phased manner which produce electricity with emissions).

3) By going to solar electricity and electric vehicles, our country is aiming at a very large goal of reducing our currency drain by way of import of petroleum products and for good financial situation.

4) If the present proposal of gross billing system of KSEB for their vested interest is accepted, I am sure that all consumers who are planning to switch to solar electricity will move back and it will be very harmful for the vision of our nation.

5) Infact I have installed a 5 kw solar solar structure for my house, investing a huge initial amount of three lakhs to participate in this great national goal of becoming self sufficient with green energy and of coure with personal interest of having savings in a long run. The present proposal of gross billing system of KSEB was not there at the time of my joining in solar. If the present proposal of gross billing system was there, I should never have decided to go for Solar. Infact KSEB is cheating its clients after pressing to go for solar with huge initial investment. Infact the interest of this invested three lakhs is more than the amount required for payment of electricity charges, if not switched to solar. Still I have participated in the scheme in the best interest of our national goal. The aim of KSEB in implementing the solar scheme seems to be just for getting the subsidy of around 5000 crores and it seems that their aim is to cheat its clients after that by these crooked ways to pick pocket from the clients. I doubt why people are bearing this 'Vellana"". It is high time for private electricity distribution system.

In fact the KSEB and the government of Kerala are pulling back the development of our nation aimed through green solar energy.


Hence I strongly requested the honorable commission not to accept the present proposal of gross billing system for solar customers.",0

It seems that BJP has given more internet through Jio. People became omniscient.,0
Good voice,1
Modi is too smart. Rahul should not have fallen into their trap.,1
"Be careful when some news comes out, the truth is different.",1
Not really Rahul but Kejriwal I think the game changed after he came out of jail. I did not say that Rahul is bad. It is the current political situation,1
"In the last election, Modi had a feeling of sympathy and it was visible on social media. But not in this case",0
A regime change is what everyone is looking forward to this year.â€,1
All these people cannot lead any discussion by blaming the Congress,0
"In our democracy, everyone has equal rights and authority. That right is not to be violated by anyone. We are bound to follow equal justice and rules. For all religious people their religion is superior. No one has the authority to question it",1
The people will welcome him with open arms if they find one who is capable of ruling all together with love and unity.,1
Jai Rahul Gandhi,1
Let India soldiers not be sacrificed for Modiâ€¦.he will do anything to winâ€¦.like Pulwama,0
"If the Indian alliance had ruled India, India would have been destroyed",0
"Fearing loss of power, they are running around holding their pay and spewing communalism and hatred.",0
Anti incumbency will increase vote .not decrease,0
"If BJP leaves power, they will always work in hiding for danger, disasters, riots, bomb blasts in India....",0
That word of Rahul ji that Modi will not come to power again. Can't just...,1
"Modiji is sure to become the Prime Minister again by the blessings of his ""Modi Magic"".",1
Where are the people in the countries where you are tyrannical...?,0
And then only ego and contempt for being great observers and Buddhists,0
J a I jai Rahulji...Indians understood who is Mr. M ody,1
We will get India back,1
"We also want Rahul to win, but now Modi will win",1
Isn't this a bit over the top?,0
hoho: That way is impossible. Modi stands in the way. No one including your channel can help Rahul.,0
"Next ten years another party... history repeats itself""",1
N.D. A slowly started putting the reverse gear,0
"That's what Rahul Gandhi said...to break Modi's confidence""",0
What an opinion BJP had enough money to spend for the campaign. Voters will do the necessary for their needs,1
Real independence day June 4,1
"When they heard that the BJP would lose, the bomb threats started",0
"This is not our Modiji's trick. No one will doubt AVM to make people feel that BJP will lose. Now every news channel is discussing whether BJP will lose. Modi won this. Our Modi is not smart as a fox, our Modiji is cunning",1
2004 will be repeated in 2024.,1
Let the Modi era end... let religious neutral India come back,0
Pappu Farik will sit at home,0
For employment vote for congress INDIA,1

"In spite of this, BJP's EVMs are going round and round - is there anywhere else on earth but in India : the election is over. After 47 days of vote counting, do you need any more proof to subvert democracy?",0
See you on June 4th,1
"The Mehtans who are posting comments should think first that any Mehtan will vote for BJP other than IUML.. It is like people in the North, they will vote for BJP...",0
The poisonous tree of Modi has been cut down and it is a small minority who hate Modi but there are a lot of non-Muslim brothers in this country who love that minority and they will definitely not support Modi.,0
"Hi.. Hi... Hi..,. What a big unfulfilled dream",0
I sincerely want India Front to come to power but I have no hope because even in Kerala where the organizational system is strong there are many Congressmen who are not named in the voter list and Congress has not been able to get even guaranteed votes in the box ???,0
Democracy will be restored on June 4 if EVMs are not rigged...,1
Try to get 50 seats,0
"Dawood, is there any new post of Atiwara??",0
In the meantime we'll be playing in the lineup and it's time for you guys to wait this long,0
Anyone can dream until June 4th,1
"If you have E Mota's phone number, he called me on June 4 and asked about it. Friend Rahul will win 50 seats first. At least he won the position of the leader of the opposition",0
"What kind of magic is he going to show for the last 5 years without turning Parliament into a battleground? What magic is he going to show? What BJP has done for 40 years now, whether he demolished the Babri mosque with a knife for secularism or supported it, no matter how much magic is added, he is not going to get more than 60 seats. Papumon pole one as a leader and others angeekarikkumo",0
You are free from hatred again in India June 4... Politics is not communalism...,1
Modi came out to play with the voting machine ready for counting on June 4.,0
The election was delayed by 3 months as it required time to reach the respective places.,0
Don't just sit on the channel and waste your time discussing it.,0
Don't just dream / India front not even 1% chance - NDA,0
Adani and Ambani were the ones who suddenly burst into power when BCP came to power,0
India will get freedom again on June 4th.. Dictator and tyrant will be gone,1
Look some talk big always. We lost from all political parties to hear about their party performance / ethics / values â€‹â€‹/ teachings etc. In five years most of the days all where hearing Ambani / Advani. Maybe Modi is thinking how congress is managing without funds which is locked by ED around 100 crores. So started looking at who is funding.,0
BJP propagates Hindutva politics and they try to implement it India is a secular country and that's enough here,0
"It is time to ban this channel, it is a channel that is trying to create a sectarianism and is sitting on poisonous seeds.",0
"After this election congress will dis appear in Punjab, Delhi now in Hindi belt they are zero, Bengal and north east zero",0

"In any case, Rahul will lose in Wayanad",0
"* When another Parliament election is coming to India, where are those 20 lakh voting machines missing from the Election Commission of India?",0
"Without changing the Evm, no lota can be done. BJP will win comfortably.. they need only evm to win",0
That Modi holding Pandaram who called the Koyas bad at Patachavan would have been shot,0
Rahul may win..... but the next prime ministerial candidate to come against Modi is Arvind Kejriwal..... if indi front gets majority he will become prime minister.....,1
Worst p.m in the world.,0
May my Modi ji rule India for another 10 years..... May he have the strength to do so,1
"â€‹ @Bondmottuji-bg3uj Another family ruled, who cares about it? India became so bad because father, mother and grandson ruled the name Congress.",0
"@user-kp9rq8xu7kÂ u don't know Indian history.u know only RSS history so u never understand the pulse of our nation.u try to look into the ruling of congress and their contribution.dont say blindly
Open ur eyes and see surrounding s. After election u understand the things let us see",0
"@Bondmottuji-bg3uj If you feel like crying, it doesn't mean I feel like crying.",0
"If he is such a great leader, then why is he so afraid of holding elections in the ballot",0
BJP will not be able to complete 25 seats out of 102,0
BJP cannot be blamed for those who have faith in EVM. The machine box has been changed and it has reached many places in Kerala and made it ready for North India.,0
@TheFighter-lx9lm What nonsense you are saying.. Congress will never win.. Then they can blame anything but evm.. I am with Congress in this matter.,0
102 out of 102 with the blessings of EVM Muthappan,0
It seems that the destruction of Kerala is the goal of literal Kerala.,0
The prediction that the media is all paid,0
"All the seats are for BJP. Don't worry, maybe you will get five or six more seats in the neighboring countries. Dim!!!",0
Go ahead BJP. May India be strong,1
"The best governance the world has ever seen is that of Shri Narendra Modi
Jai Modiji
Jai Bharat",1
You are not supposed to do post poll..,0
"In the last election, out of these 102 seats, BJP had 48 seats, out of which 20 seats will be lost",0
"BJP loose more seats,",0
"If the EVM scam in Kerala stings the Congress, it should be covered in lotus flowers",0
But then the Congress will get the lotus flower,1
There has never been a dictator in the world who has done so much corruption and communalism,0
It was only when Pinarayi was supported at this moment that the India alliance is a group of people who have cheated and cheated.,0
You are uniting the people and how will the Indian front win this fight this is an opportunity to liberate India,1
God is there. Always if writing is there nobody can do anything,1
Let's see how long they will go ahead by dividing the people,0
"You accused of corruption and brought down the Congress and drowned the gentleman who was with you. You cheated the people who believed in you and indirectly supported the BJP to implement citizenship. People want you to come to the people again. People hate BJP and Modi and his entourage. So people will give you one more chance, use it for secular India. Indian people are enlightened and no one should try to make them foolish. The result is going to happen to Modi if he tries",0
Where what he developed Only Ambani Adani ?can you say any one ?All are already existed he that cunning fox uses some Hindi words instead of English speedily spread it through medias,0
But still they didn't understand also they are thinking after election also 3rd term for NDA.,0
"All will be put in jail. Let's win one. please The defendant no more. Such is the case with Russia, China, and North Korea",0
Sorryyy Kejriwalâ€¦ We could do little to save for standing for people of Indiaâ€¦..,0
"Cummi and Kongi earlier told this bloody kejriwal and AAP is the B Team of BJP, now these people glorify him, what a shame!",0
@dsm2962 Didn't one family rule for 60 years.. Didn't democracy and opposition come now..?,0
Kejari... You are the right person to be the Prime Minister,1
Fighting corruption in 2015 and fighting corruption in 2024. They and their ministers will be jailed in jail for corruption.,0
"It is great strategy of RSS to promote Kejriwall. Like what happened in Bangladesh...as multiparty system is required in democracy, Haseena split her own party with her loyal men and branded and promoted as opposition so that she will have a loyal opposition at the same time it serves as multi party system. Yongendra Yadav example

 RSS is grooming BJP ""B"" party that is APP with different kind of Hinduism and slight modernity to implement Sangh Agenda...

In the absence of lost glory of BJP, Kejriwall will take over the Sangh flag and continue RSS agenda

India alliance is only a platform for Kejriwall and once He reaches his orbit he will expel or eject from secular group and continue in RSS orbit...

Anna Hasare movement is organized by RSS. Kejriwall still his disciple. All secular rooted leaders of APP left his party.

Congress will remain as what it is now.

Arrest of KEJRIWAL is not blunder of RSS but a calculated move to boost his image above Rahul.",0
He was released to find out what his connections were and he could never be released again after this!,0
Congress gave case against kejarival bjp sent him jail but he is coming out,0
"He is option b of sanghpariwar.l 1.He was only CM in india jailed and given veer parivesh nerha 2.he n his members voice same like jay sreeram team.3.he did not speach a bout minorities. if failed bjp, we can see the corporate sanghism!!",0
Kejerival is in fools paradise. Modi wants you around... he wants as many parties around and also in the contesting field. So that opposition's vote would b split into different parties..,0
Tributes to Pradhanmairan Modi,1
"In the last Lok Sabha election, Modi did not get the money he had to contest. How many seats did the app get in Kejriwal's powerhouse Delhi?",0
"âœ‹ï¸âœ‹ï¸Arvind Kejriwal,Stalin,Sitaram Yechury,Mallikarjun Kharge,Pappu what will happen if all of them try to become PMjune 04",0
Keralites of their own they do nothing but at the same time they want to enjoy the struggle of others .They support the culprits who is in the super post That is why Driver is left alone and all are with Mayor,0
"Kejiri ur cheated that Hazareji The great man and now ur talking all nonsense, pls stop it",0
"â˜ï¸â˜ï¸â˜ï¸Narendra Bharatham
Don't underestimate BJP is powerful. BJP ruled in India power double strong. 2024.election BJP Win above 350 seats confirm â˜ï¸",1
Just don't be corrupt like him,0
"That means you don't believe our country's strength.
Even Indira Gandhi gave her blood to protect India.
India will never divide.
Kejriwal is a strong opposition leader",1
"Don't just count.

Modi came out to play with the voting machine ready for counting on June 4.

The election was delayed by 3 months as it required time to reach the respective places.

The NDA alliance will win at least 300 seats.

Don't just sit on the channel and waste your time discussing it.

If you have other work at that time, go and do that at least.",0
21 days parol only....back to jail 4 netas corrupted....so they are in Jail,0
What to do this corruption hero Modi?,1
"Don't worry mr. Kejriwal, after June 4th each one of you corrupt politicians will be jailed. Your count down will start after June 4th.",0
I also called my friend Shah and Namo and they said the same thing that Kejriwal will loss.,0
It was the poetic justice of the times that it took the Congress itself to release him who threw the Congress out of power due to non-existent corruption,0
"Modi and Shaji will not touch the ground in this Lok Sabha election, not the next election, but the next one...",0
It's been 15 years since I started saying this and still it hasn't happened and it won't happen again,0
Kudos to you for having the courage to take a stand and make it public,1
"Being in Kerala, whatever our opinions are, we can say them without fearing anyone.!!",1

"He's a leader who even after losing back to back elections, stayed in the constituency and worked with the people. He's the celebrity who spends a big chunk of the money he makes from movies for charity and humanitarian purposes.",1
Suresh Gopi will win for the development of Thrissur,1
"Whether Shobha wins or loses, the BJP has every chance of getting a new spokesperson.",1
Suresh Gopi is the perfect candidate. His support from the people is more than any other candidates. Modi effect is fantastic. Suresh Gopi will be the winner of Thrissur,1
"Suresh Gopi & Rajeev Chandrashekhar are the qualified candidate for do better, they have knowledge enough for make better..",1
Suresh Gopi is a great person pure lovely and a philanthropic human. He will be accepted by all sections of the people. He is sure to win.,1
Such a clarity in his talk makes him different from other candidates...people of Thrissur deserve an MP like him.,1
He will win. He has a big heart and also understands the difficulty of the common people.Kerala people must vote him and see the difference.All prayers for Suresh Gopi's victory,1
Yes thats the point.. people see suresh gopi for the person he is and have high hopes on him. God bless him with a victorious victory for the good recovery of the state and a bright future for the state,1
There is a need of some sort of luck to make people tell something good. That is Shailaja teacher.,1
I am very happy that at least one person with brain has come to the cabinet,1
May our minister be able to reach people's minds and work,1
Nayanar and EMs are my favorite leaders and now I am a teacher in that group,1
A good minister who shows some responsibility in the work he does,1
"Although I am not a Markxist, but I am happy with the success of the teacher",1
Shafi's words should be written in golden letters,1
Very intelligent Minister!!,1
We are happy to get a Minister of Transport like this . We have enough people like this,1
Sir big salute to you. Let this be the beginning of a good future for motor vehicle department in Kerala.,1
Shailaja should come again for evening briefing for reducing covid. Her instructions will be viewed like a mother's and everyone will remember that and prompted to behave as she directs.,1
Shafi is a gem of Vadakara,1
"This lady?, the iron lady of Kerala",1
"When I see the teacher, I feel a lot of confidence",1
Vote For Shafi Paramba to wipe out violent politics from the soil of Vadakara,1
I get goosebumps while hearing Shafi's speech.,1
I voted for BJP this time. But Shafi is a young man who has hope in Congress,1
"Shafi a gem of a politician, very articulate and assertive. Smart, intelligent and media-savvy with enough common sense. He deserves to be in parliament",1
"Shafi till now..... You have not spoken like that with arrogance as you or I... We, We .. are there.... It is respectful to criticize even the ideas of the opposite candidate.. . People of Vadakkara were very lucky and can't get anymore a person like you",1
All the people's representatives who stand for the people of the country should be victorious. We the people will find them and win them for sure,1
Wishing a lot of congratulations to the people for the love shown to them with the confidence that they will return more than that,1
"In Shafi Parambil, your voice has the ability to identify with the voice of the people. May God give that mind and body the ability to remain the same",1
"I am a voter in Alappuzha constituency, I will always pray for Shafi Ikka's victory",1
Shafi will win with a majority of 1 lakh voters. Guarantee,1
We hope for a woman CM who should win the teacher,1
"Issac sir has very good points which seems true, then this could be presented before the ED without waiting for further summons",1
"Shafi is a mature leader. How humble of speech. Isn't his Guru Oommen Chandy... that modesty in speech.... The people of Vadakara can trust... will be with him."" ""A young leader who runs for anything",1
This government should continue and this Kerala should shine. Salutations to the left wing of Kerala!,1
In such a clear way People will support Shafi who knows how to speak politics Guaranteed,1
"Shafi, you are an evergreen leader in India. Your voice is extraordinary and plays a crucial role in upholding our democracy",1
Mr. Shafi is a very well spoken person and wish him all the best,1
"After the passing away of Oommen Chandy sir, Kerala got a disciple who has the good qualities of sir Shafi",1
There is no doubt that the people of Palakkad will always say that Shafi is an unassuming personality,1
"The people of Vadakara are very lucky to have a candidate like this. In my place, a person like this is hoping to become a candidate. I am grateful to the people of the district who voted so much",1
This revolutionary star will remain forever in the minds of the people,1
"EMS, THE GREAT MAN IN KERALA NO DOUBT.",1
Suresh Gopi's presence in politics is refreshing. His vision for economic progress and his dedication to the people are very inspiring,1
I came from Dubai with my family. Thrissur will vote for SG. SG will get a majority of 50000 votes,1
You are to the point and straight. Thank you for the dissecting analysis. ,1
"Good hospitality, will enhance relationship. Best opportunity, you got it.",1
"Modi has most civilized manners and behaviours in the world itself and that is why LEADERS and RULERS of most of the NATIONS like France, UK, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Japan, Italy etc give high respect and love to MODI as a WISE and LOVING BROTHER",1
Educated honest serving that is suresh Gopi,1
"He’s a leader who even after losing back to back elections, stayed in the constituency and worked with the people. He’s the celebrity who spends a big chunk of the money he makes from movies for charity and humanitarian purposes.",1
There was tremendous development during Congress rule which cannot be ruled out and which has been carried over in the present decade. Therefore Congress will win in Kerala with huge margins.,1
Kozhikode ksrtc stand Vengalam bypass Koyilandy railway overbridge etc Oommen Chandy gifted in my Kozhikode Love you Oommen Chandy,1

Chandi Oommen should come. He certainly deserves to follow in the footsteps of Oommen Chandy.,1
It is certain that the children brought up by Oommen Chandy will have his character. Election is a test. So tell him to participate,1
They got a leader and are proud of him. The greatest reward for a human in his life.,1
He is floating on people and it is his strength. Unbelievable politician.,1
The word which V S Achuthanandan says where still lightens the people,1
VS is a leader who always foresees things to come,1
Like a visionary he predicted all that is happening at present in Kerala,1
I am not a communist. But i like his bravery..,1
A Chief Minister with a long vision is the pride of our Palakkad people,1
"He was a true Nationalist l. I may disagree with communist ideology, but VS needs to be acknowledged for saying the truth!!!",1
Great revelation far sighted ..he was an excellent leader,1
A person who likes from the Communist Party is V S...,1
VS laughed at thinking about upcoming events.,1
A real living communist. Lalsalam comrade...,1
"I am a BJP supporter but always have respect for people like him in the communist movement, real winners are those who face defeat with a smile.",1
The best Communist alive today in the Communist Party,1
This is how the Chief Minister should be like the Chief Minister of Kerala Miss u V S...... Real communist,1
Crying to the skin? A good example of Vs. LDF won 4 seats in 2009 and only 1 in 2019. There is nothing in crying and laughing. action,1
I am a BJP guy... But... Nayanar sir and VS sir... Spr... Everything else..........,1
"I became a communist because of this man... But today I understand and am done with this man, Communism in India is",1
There is no faith in the idea of ??a separate party. But he is one of those people who can be liked regardless of the party. VS,1
"Even the Congress, CPM and BJP leaders were shocked to see the people's support for Oommen Chandy",1
"Vishwaguru's question is who is the Prime Minister of India Front, there is a Nehru blood who challenged in the Lok Sabha, the tainted patriotism and uplifting the essence of the Constitution, our Rahul Gandhi is the Prime Minister of India who has the strength to guide the Election Commission to the right path, thank you!! Common man's tax can be used for the upliftment of the common man and open shops of love in the circle of hate to live happily, that's what Rahul Gandhi did in Karnataka and Telangana.",1
"In today's situation, Chandy will win in Pudupally.. that is for sure.. and it will be like Chandy's performance. Chandy will never be a people's representative who forgets the people and walks in power.. He is a good leader who knows how to work and a future Chief Minister.",1
I am underlining that Chandi Oommen will rule Kerala in the future,1
"Even if Chandi Kunju runs, if he walks without chappal, he will not get tired of anything. He is the one who walked with Rahul Gandhi in the Bharat Choto Yatra. Our Chandi Kunju will win and get the best majority.",1
"Anil Antony is young, well read, intelligent and hardworking. Most of all he is the son of an honest leader. He deserves to win",1
He has not walked through drawn swords.. but he has walked through the tears of weeping men.,1
"Anil is a phenomenal youth leader and hope for Kerala and India. He is educated, he is through bred financial and political analyst. He has world exposure. He is well bred with a wonderful pedigree of truthfulness through his clean image political vizard who has many records to his credit. Nothing is more important than a clean non-corrupt image and position as the most faithful congressman and patriotic Indian. There is no Politician perhaps in the world like him with this cleanliness, untouched by political corruption. Anil carries this legacy with the legacy of his very special mother who is such a philanthropist and women with empathy for downtrodden especially women. Undoubtedly ANIL WILL AND SHOULD WIN FOR KERALA AND INDIA",1
"Shasi Tharoor Even if you have to stay away from the candidate list, you should be with the common people",1

He is one of the good quality political leader,1
"When retire, he can be the best adviser to the youngsters.",1
"people like Shasi Tharoor, need to enter politics in abundance..",1
But the fact is best political leader the Indian youth love is Tharoorji,1
Feeling respect to this person irrespective the party.,1
He is an intellectual. Not at all a politician. Also a Global Citizen.,1
Yes what he said is correct. Why this much age gap??? Because the people are young and we have 60+ people ruling in the cabinet. We need young blood and they'll have more ideas and concepts.,1
"Sir. You are always fit to be the Prime Minister of India. You are very knowledgeable.
To replace it
Today, to my knowledge, no one else is eligible in India",1

Congratulations for your suggestions,1

Maybe Rahul is honest,1
Rahul is right and does not hide the truth. ...Rahul said this and the truth about how India should be. ......Anyone can become a politician. Politics that is good for India is not for the poor â˜ï¸,1
Yes accurate observation BJP is back in power,1
@RajeshSivan-sb2nh has started in bjp to elect president,1

I agree with what Rahul said.. You are right,1
Anyway can be justified..Rahul. Rahul is smart,1
Rahul you have become very mature Congratulations,1
"Very good review and very good message..
Thank you Rahul Eshwar",1
"If every party has a secular leader, all parties are super",1
"Why is Modi's education not disclosed? Modi's speech is at the level of a person who is not even a 10th grader. Words that should never come from the mouth of an ordinary politician. How many castes in India are allowed to worship Rama? We have more than three thousand castes. Then there are more than twenty-five thousand sub-castes. That is, untouchables and those who have food. Once Vayalar Ravi's son's marriage was conducted in Guruvayoorambalam, what a commotion there was.",1
Raman is not a god..He is a human form of Vishnu..Anyone can follow him and people love Raman because he is Maryada purushottaman..He is not a god like Vishnu or Shiva..Just a human..,1
"If you see the thinking of Modi and his friends, that is the funny thing that Sri Rama belongs only to BJP people",1
"Otherwise, it is better if the canoe is hidden",1
"Thank you Rahul
Good thinking",1
"Uttar Pradesh has the highest number of homeless people. Therefore, Lord Ram decided not to arrange for me to stay in such a big house for the time being. The defeat happened there because the Lord had decreed that all the subjects of Uttar Pradesh could enter the house only after the house was ready.",1

"Rahul has changed a lot as a person. We should appreciate that. He learned from his mistakes, his words, now he is a better person.",1
To change color like this one. Can't even come to a good talk,1
Rahul first time u impressed me,1

"What kind of justice does a Prime Minister do to the Constitution of India, who stirs up the people of the country to the point of killing each other on the basis of casteism? In fact, he should not be placed in any constitutional position",1
"The whole world sees India as our unity in diversity, secularism and democracy, our different religions, bhakshas, â€‹â€‹culture and food. The world is watching with wonder how India manages these diversities and not in ending the communal divides minorities.

Those who enter the administration should strive and try to unite the country and bring the welfare of the country. .",1
You said very well.. Will I get heaven or something?,1
I saw a post on fb yesterday morning saying that if BJP comes to power this time there is no Allah or Allah is BJP. You didn't say that much,1
Â @nurhudamadeena3234 First try to get power we don't have 5 Prime Ministers then Congress I don't blame them but they managed to achieve it alone but there was a sympathy wave,1
"It should not be underestimated that in the third round too, the bjp single-handedly won more than the opposition's 28 seats. BJP votes have also been decisive in the victory of allies who contested under the NDA brand. They have immense leadership skills to build the cabinet and carry it with discipline, cohesion and stability. If there is defection and a tug of war there, they know the tricks of the trade to find a solution to that problem. Let India grow as a world power no matter who rules.",1
Suresh Gopi now put on a respectable dress I remember what he said a year ago bulldozers in UP should be used in Kerala we can't forget that Suresh Gopi won is a game played by Congress and CPM It is a pre-arranged murder to prevent Murali from becoming Chief Minister Murali was left to be killed After seeing the current situation at the center Suresh Gopi started showing secular character inside him Hiding,1
Lord Rama must not have liked that the church was demolished and a temple was built in his name on the site of the church. Of course It will be thought that at least this kind of punishment should be given,1
"It took this election to make us understand that we cannot win in India on the basis of casteism, we only need to see that Rahul is changing the plate.",1
"Without his extreme left and extreme right, there are no other arrows in his quiver, my Lord Shiva...",1
The real reason for the defeat was the demolition of the Babri mosque and the construction of the temple,1
Suresh Gopi won not because of his party. But he is a good human being,1
"Sharikkum onth, Suresh gopiye modhi role model aakkanam very good opinion",1

Rahul Gandhi's sweet revenge for teasing him by calling him Pappu,1
Hey Rahul. How lightly it is said that because of not giving compensation for the loss of house and land in Ayodhya. There are many stories of innocent souls to be told.,1
Enthenkilum..Para clear ayi,1
This victory is not the victory of the party called BJP. This victory is the vote for the owner of a good mind named Suresh Gopi,1
Hashmi Taj Ibrahim Rahul Pappu should give a grand introduction the next day to become Wayanad PM again.,1
It will be said that right and left should be called for discussion until they are neutral.  Do not touch the face of the onion spot!!,1
A lot has been experienced for Rama since time immemorial. Raman himself will lead the country in the future too. Do not quarrel with those who give you energy to talk.,1

Do you want that much Rahul.. Didn't you go a little over.. Oh,1
How easily he justifies the Prime Minister's racist - xenophobic - alienation. Damn,1
Rahul flew sathyam. India needs a strong opposition.,1
Then that is the real Jai Shriram,1
Being Prime Minister and not being able to do anything that you set out to do is a greater punishment than being in the opposition,1
This election is a message that Modi should live as a human being. Modi should never have done such cruelty to the people of this country. It would be better if there was no more guilt.,1
This country will not be better without burning all this rat waste.,1
"[At 3:00] As Rahul Eshwar admits, Rahul, who was ""hurt"" when ""Madhavi Lata"" swung a bow against a mosque, has no pain at all when he thinks about Babu Bajrangi, who killed Indian Muslim women and pregnant women in Naroda Patiya in 2002 and hid him in a guest house in Mt Abu, Rajasthan.... But when I hear that it is worship, I feel amazing!!!",1
Lord Rama threw away the first thing he took and Vivekananda also asked who are you and who do you think?,1
Where is the strong opposition? The indi front is a ball handled by the pale air valves pale leaders. You can't say who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one who will be the one.,1
"If the canoe is hidden, then it is better to go out. What is Rahul's happiness?",1

"I can't stand it.. No matter how many sit-ins, SG won.",1
"It is a personal vote given by the people to SG Sir! , he is a good man",1
people are watching him past 10 years and they know the truth that he is the most generous person with good deeds,1
Muslim love is the reason,1
", 24 news channel's historical discovery everyone listen carefully a boy is moaning for some reason why should you get some hot water ",1
Sg is never a religious voter and he has the goodness to see all men as equals. That is the success of sg,1
"Suresh Gopi is a man with heart, many Muslims have voted for him this time, Christian and Hindu have voted, they are all from Thrissur and this time, he has done a good thing, I am from Kollam, I am also sad that I can't vote for SG.",1
SGâ€¦â€¦what are you sayingâ€¦â€¦he won by peopleâ€™s voteâ€¦..when listening to your story tell somethingâ€¦â€¦.acknowledge his victory firstâ€¦â€¦you Find out why the first losers lost...,1
Nice work bro,1
Also the talent of bjp district president... Aneesh is a good coordinator and visionary,1
"Venu, very good analysis, ",1
Suresh Gopi will be a Cabinet Minister at the centre. He will surely do a good job. Congratulations to SG.,1
Great analysis,1
Best explanation.,1
"I'm afraid LDF UDF may align in Trissur to have only 1 candidate. ,which will be very interesting if they did that.",1
Absolutely good observation! But it's for shining future!,1
Cool description. Super,1
"Ever loving person is Suresh Gopi irrespective of Religion .A loving family 
Secularist. Muralidharan is respected 
and not avoiding him. Peace be with him.",1
The boil of the worm bite.. a great genius.. oh amazing invention.. don't sunbathe on that bald head..,1

DECENT OBSERVATIONJAY INDIA,1
Very correct observation,1
"Sir super deeply examined and excellent criticism 
on Suresh Sir' devoted work and campaign ",1
Very good review. Good message,1
Super analysis,1
How did you see so much?,1
Good observation.  Go ahead.,1
"Super, wish and pray that Suresh Gopi remains an MP and minister for a long time, for the welfare of the commons.",1
Wow... I didn't say this before the result,1
Good report,1
Chandran Mullachery's voice is excellent,1
Suresh gopi great,1
"Tomorrow we will come with a new story about Thiruvananthapuram, Atingal and Alappuzha",1
Perhaps the left and right have understood that Kerala is not Balikeramala for BJP. Here all the minorities voted for Suresh Gopi. Congratulations,1
True it is not because of BJP's merit but that person's merit,1
TRUE,1
God is kind,1
True words,1
The people of Thrissur showed good intelligence...SG won,1
"A gentle man, lovely man, kind minded man, A real man with extra dreams",1
"Whatever engineering is their skill..
People like SG will be liked, accepted and loved by the people no matter which party they belong to.
      No one should even dream that they will get Thrissur from the hands of SG.",1
"Real politics, association of generous mind, must CONTINUE, FURTHER FUTURE",1
"Exactly right, but he has a good heart.",1
state award for a good narrative 24. How much did you get?,1
Suresh Gopi is a good man...that's the secret of success...,1
"Exactly the same strategy will continue in trivandrum, aleppy too.. ",1
Neither of the factors you have inferred and detailed here supported his victory other than the inherent mental attitude of women voters towards Suresh Gopi paved his way to victory.,1
Suresh Gopi nice person.we vote him,1
"Regardless of politics
 A good person won.. ",1
SG Suresh Gopi is the golden son of Kerala,1
more than what u said people trusted him,1
Can you tell me what kind of social engineering was used to win Shafi Vadakara from Palakkad...?,1
"You are 100
is ok",1
"If Poten does well, everyone wins",1
Suresh Gopi is a man of integrity and sincerity. A man who keeps his words and promises. Both UDF and LDF use Christians only for votes and after winning ignore them. Now the quiet and law abiding Christians have proved they can give a 'shock treatment'. Never again take their votes for granted. Earn it for yourselves by listening to them and meeting their needs.,1
Ask sir to tell you how much you got.,1
"This is a kind of jealousy, as they say that there is no medicine for envy and bitterness",1
He was humiliated by Murali's jihadist appeasement and disregard for other communities. Politicians are responsible for giving equal justice to everyone without stooping to such a level.,1
SURESH GOPI _ Super Hero _,1
"Suresh Gopi worked there sincerely for last five years. It is not enough to come to the constituency only during the election.
The parties should decide now who will contest the next time and start working",1
"When the league said that our people don't need Murali, our man Shafi is enough, they got rid of Murali as a nice...",1
"Yes
The observation is accurate",1
Don't you say something to make Venu happy too?,1
BJP will win many constituencies in Kerala. That is what the BJP's vote increase in many constituencies this time shows,1
"Called Sangi, Krisangi
Effectively evolved
First time in Kerala
Cultural capital
It is in Thrissur. Slow down now 
Slowly in other mandals too
We can see it with a refreshing view.",1
No it's purely heart based... No need for any evaluation... People started to vote based on people,1
The role of the media in creating communal slums is also not small,1
This is not BJP's win but it is S.G personal win with his winning appeal. It is a proof from his speech after winning the Trissur seat. He must remember the fate of Smruthi Irani if â€‹â€‹he changes his policies from the present secular thinking.,1
"In any case, Sureshgopi has reached the hearts of the people because of the good service he has given us.",1
"Go ahead
Women are the architects of success",1
"This is the first political strategy of BJP..if it has a strong base, it will bring out its own image....UDF LDF fronts in Kerala realized this and could not throw an inch earlier..stood idle..",1
What is he saying?... Is he full of racism?,1
Not a single good comment in your favor,1
"One hundred percent true, many people I know, including myself, voted for Notta, as well as those who did not vote, the positions of Congress, especially VD Satee Shan, were insulting to Christians. UDF's victory is due to prideful hatred of Pinarayi regime and Govindanmash, if there were good BJP candidates in every constituency they would have won.",1
ninnum of you heard the core observation after many years..,1
Proud to be a Thrissurian... Thrissurians can't be fooled when they say it.... SGBJP,1
Excellent analysis by Shri Venu.,1
"Sir, what you are saying is not true at all. Pradiksha is a Hindu who lived here not BJP but human love. Christian. Muslim is not. How many Muslim children have voted? People want a good person. Experimenting with genes is for good. I have a word for Suresh Gopi sir. This is not your victory, it is not BJP's victory, the genes are testing you",1
Flute sound,1
Pratapan's call came from Thrissur when Muraliettan was doing social emginnering in Vadakara.,1
"Pulli understood that Suresh Gopi won't tolerate it, that's why he is trying hard to see if he can extinguish the light of his victory.",1
"If you listen to what he says, it is as if he has seen it right",1
Not because of helping others. 24 news is good,1
"There is no point in crying only when they win, after a while they will reveal the truth and when the oath is over, Modi also came and cried saying that he did not lose but won.",1
B J P STRONG KERALA,1
Thrissur has become a cultural city that can't be used for anything.,1
Social Engineering KKPP of Congress,1
"Reason for Congress loss: 
1. Hamazolitaram 
2. Support terrorism 
3. Taking advantage of crowning the mother 
4. Unnecessary Controversy by Media Worker 
5. Suresh Gopi is a good man",1
Not only he is a human than your calculation so study some more about SG,1
"It is not a fairy tale. First Muralidharan should come among the people. How can Murali, who does not understand the plight of the people who do not come out of the house, run away from the people? Yes, Sureshgopi has done it.",1
That is the only public support a good man has got. Everyone who eats rice knows what this wonderful invention means,1
The biggest relief in this election is not blaming EVMs for the Sanghs. Can anyone bear to blame an object which he esteems more than his own?,1
Why did LDF &UDF not implement SG's plan? Shameless to say?? Thanks,1
Don't vote for those who supported Hamas but will vote for those who killed their own brothers in Manipur.,1
Kuthi Thirip Channel. People love goodness. No one looks at the party. Aren't you here to write palace secrets?,1
"Suresh Gopi has not done any of the social engineering that Sunil Kumar has been working on for years in Thrissur. Sunil Kumar has more social influence than Suresh Gopi.
Thrissur is politically a Congress constituency. Suresh Gopi's victory is the change in their vote. Congress leaders in Thrissur made it! 

It is petty and ridiculous to judge the people of Thrissur by caste by creating sectarianism such as Christian vote and Hindu vote.",1
Missed the main (core 7:55) pointâ€¦.,1
Simple.. The people of Thrissur realized that Sureshgopi was a good leader even though it was a little late.. They chose him for them.. It doesn't need much explanation.,1
Murali better go to BJP,1
"Religion says Kerala, media, politics, good man has won and that's it, don't get high.",1
My dear sir corrected me in Malayalam saying we have threatened cardinal and fathers we will stop the funds coming from abroad we will put you inside through BJP if I win I will get rid of you from all that turn around and lie down why are you repeating this sir stop,1
"Shree Suresh Gopi's secularism is not for votes like Ganesh Kumar, even if Ganesha wins a thousand births he cannot stand on the four feet of Suresh Gopi.",1
Suresh Gopi's lawsuit against Media One for talking on the shoulder of a female reporter of Media One has caused a large number of women to sympathize with Suresh Gopi. Realize that women see this issue differently than men.  A woman's mind cannot be seen through the eyes of male religion.,1
LDF helped in consolidation of Hindu and Christian votes by supporting Hamas and appeasing minority.,1
"So if the religious and communal Fascist RSS guy wins, isn't he a social engineer.. If Shafi wins, it's religious unification.. Shameless uncle media thumpers â€¼ï¸",1
"Golden friend, why so much research, if the people are convinced that the person is good, they will definitely win.",1
"Many women voters who thought they were UDF went to SG. Movie actor, good height, flying kiss ... women are not naturally volatile",1
"No matter how much you cry, Suresh Gopi's success will be accepted by those who listen to media clowns and laugh.",1
"A Christian Muslim Lehala was planned to be made in Kerala, centered in Thrissur town.. Fortunately, it was decided not to do it again....... Some moderates in the BJP itself. .. due to the timely intervention of those who were involved..... their majority target was 150000...",1
Oralu wins because he gets more votes,1
Ningalude ee video um channel um vare oru social kuthithirup engineering alle??,1
Venu good story and never ever accept BJP won the election because mind still with CPM venu and his brother both are against BJP as journalists should be an independent,1
"Both the left and the right think that the Christian minority is a cash cow. Even though it is not as much as that of CPM and UDF, if the favoring of one section continues, the foundation of CPM and UDF will still be shaken. After winning, if they try not to look back at that constituency, then they will have defeated him. When Ari, Malar and Kunthirik were threatened, the inaction of Pinarayi government caused a rift in this society.",1
What kind of stories are you making....doesn't he have any other work....suresh gopi...what is sprouted in the fire will not wither in the sun...,1
A great sight,1
"Yes, sir, it was the Christian who won.. He will win again... But what Israel is experiencing today, after some time, we too will have to experience it.. Do you understand, sir?",1
Suresh Gopi's win for you can be understood by the worm's bite,1
"If Suresh Gobi didn't win e times, Suresh Gobi would have been worth it.",1
"Did you understand all this now?
Isn't it good if you do social engineering and succeed?",1
"Ha ha ha ha ........according to this journalist, BJP is a Hindu Party, then what about Communist, is it Muslim party or Christian party... you are talking non-sense without the ground reality. In the first place Mr. Suresh Gopi sincerely, worked for the people in need. Yes, you are right, Mr. Suresh Gopi had a close contact with Christians, but he was not carried away into Christian an agenda but took them into confidence. Suresh Gopi political conviction and a dedicated service to the people, irrespective of party background. 
Politicians of Kerala must learn from Mr. Suresh Gopi's example of people-oriented party work, and not mere professional political work, as means for building up popularity, position, and wealth making, using all means corruption, and meaningless dramas. People reject such professional political works of politicians. Political work is for the nation building and working for the welfare of all people without corruption. Once the Party exists for the people and the nation, position, popularity and means of service automatically comes to the dedicated political workers.  If politicians cannot do this kind of work, they should be rejected and thrown into the dust bin. Mr. Suresh Gopi served the people and the nation. Nation first, then the rest.",1
There is no problem if you win by saying Eke Kati Pratapan,1
"Fayankara invention. You are not a golden boy, a golden boy. Get up and leave.",1
"This is the mind of good people.. If you listen to your speech, you will know that it is a communal speech...",1
"He won in Thrissur not because of social engineering but because of media engineering. Till April 20, Sureshgopi took the mic until he went to the toilet and went after Nalla and successfully marketed it smoothly.",1

"That's right.  But without whitewashing it by calling it social engineering, Modi has been plotting for ages to spread the lotus somewhere in the south. Shit Gopi is the perfect actor for that. Segregation of people.  Christian votes were targeted and acted well. The required money has been received through electoral bonds.  With that money, the mother gets a crown, Vishu kainitham and so on.  Mapra was also with you? Then Prathapana's foot became a support.  In any case, this became a stain on the cultural capital.

Didn't all Hindus experience the results of swallowing water without touching it for so long?",1

"As long as there is a section that calls the one who sees it as father for the sake of success, the BJP has nothing to fear, no matter how it goes, there are 6 MPs in the Congress from Kerala alone, which has 18 percent. All
The parties, even the BJP now, are at odds. giving That is the skill.",1
Great discovery... He is a good philanthropist and Thrissur car won Suresh Gopi by looking at that humanity.. I did not expect this from a news 24 channel..,1
Voters in UP are much better than Christian voters in Trissur,1
Here Hindu Christian communalism is really the victory.,1

After Janab Shafi Parambil's first entry as MP in Lokhsabha. After that what you are going to do in Loksabha and how you are going to do at least the minimum program for the Mathethatahwam voters.
Congress party betrayed the sitting MP Sri Muralidharan who again he wanted to stand in Vadakara. 
But due to the pressure of one Mathethatahwam alliance party in UDF has only paved the way for Janab Shafi Parambil to get the congress party candidate chance.
But we the citizens are thankfull to this change of shifting Sri Mural from Vadakara to Thrissur. 
This has become the golden opportunity for BJP candidate Sri Suresh Gopi to win the seat in Thrissur. The Christian religious community of Syro Malabar, CSI CHURH members, Malakara Orthodox Church members, Kaldaya church members, majority of Patriotic Muslims and Hindus together voted Sri Suresh Gopi to win. Jai Bharath",1
"Shafi from Vadakara, don't forget what you are doing in Vadakara. Shafika, there is more.",1
This is the original communal victory,1
It is a vote for a good person named Sureshgopi and not for BJP's party,1
Exactly,1
"If so, don't win last time",1
Shafi is ok…,1
Shafi won the hearts of the people. And Suresh Gopi. That is the right.,1
"@ahrafma7139 Shafi Njaman's man, Gopi Sanki and other religions, right? ",1
BJP's victory is sure... Suresh Gopi is BJP's MP... Now MP will decide only the party's stand,1
"Yes, top notch ",1
â€‹@DarkStorm7 Isn't that true,1
"If this was the party's victory and not SG's victory, how many seats would have been won? Let the poor man sit for five years and try to get two entrances.",1
SG himself said that success is personal,1
This is the vote of an individual named Suresh Gopi. I also like aa person with sincere words,1
This success is the result of what you have done in the society,1
"Mr. Adimudi is honorable, honest and a lover of humanity. Suresh is proud of Gopi's success. A thousand congratulations â™¥ï¸â™¥ï¸â™¥ï¸",1
"He has said honestly. Did Modi also hear?
People who knew the character of the person was good and voted regardless of the party. Congratulations.",1
Many wanted this green man to win,1
"Apart from you, why didn't any other leader of BJP win, including the president lost",1
It was said that I want Suresh Gopi and Shafi to win in Kerala,1
Cry more,1
"No matter how much Tvm you get, you will not learn..",1
"Congratulations dear SG!  
Good interview. Glad to hear your views & how you plan to develop the other districts too.",1
"The truth is that you won not because you are BJP but because you are a good person, don't forget this humanity",1
"So Inger himself says that this is not BJP's victory..other candidates can be proud..they got their own political votes..then this is also BJP's political failure...and with a BJP MP, Modi's communalism will gain strength in Thrissur..I am worried about Thrissur.",1
"Suresh Gopi good person. I am Communist - But, I like him. Laal Salaam!!!",1
Polichu Welcome NDA. Love you Thrissur,1
Truthful and realistic statement by Sri.Suresh Gopi. Acknowledging the decision of The Voters of Trichur.,1
Ok... didn't you win... Go and rule well.. Ok by the by,1
A very honorable campaign. The truth that only a lifelong learner will take the truth. These words of the arrogant Murali helped sir in his success. May he continue to work and campaign in such a way that no one feels bad. All the best.,1
Everything is clear and there is hope,1
"Suresh Gopi Don't be stupid, a person named Suresh Gopi can't contest even 20 seats. Before this O. Rajagopalan won. Successful as a person. If you talk communally, you will not get votes. It was not only in Kerala but it made the BJP aware of this result",1
"Thrissur gave a good deal. Chai Kudi result, push too much and die",1
Adhani's coin throw win...,1
"For those who do not have a health card place for the poor, make sure to do these two things, sir",1
Suresh Gopi should better understand the people as an MP and think beyond caste and religion lines,1
Sureshetta wishes you all the best,1
Action should be taken against T N Prathap,1
As a person we feel u will do many things for kerala not only for trissur..,1
Agree with that. Gone are the days when you would stab yourself without thinking about anything. It shows that it is not possible to complete two where it is said to get twelve by addition and subtraction!!,1

This is a personal success .not political,1
Suresh Gopi's success is well deserved may all his work be blessed and be good for the country.  All the best and God bless,1
Right talk Suresh gopi..,1
Perfect profaneness in every word of Suresh Gopi.. Political activities and election contest has matured him well.,1
Sureshgopi is convinced that he knows how to speak politics and I have heard someone say that politics is a different kind of politics.,1
good man,1
"It is not the votes that BJP got but the personal absolute votes that Suresh Gopi got, there is no way for BJP to claim that.",1

"Until now, those who have been asking for votes in the name of the party, after winning, say that this is not the party's victory but my victory. So who are the BJP workers who worked day and night to win him?",1

Very fine replies by Shafi... Amazing,1
My dear I was there listening to his speech. Rahul never spoke against Pinnarayi Vijayan.. Do you know why Rahul Gandhi said what he said because past many days Pinnarayi Vijayan has been attacking Rahul Gandhi and Congress party for no reason as he claims he is part of India Alliance then why did he say Congress is not worthy to win the coming election?? Why he said Rahul is unworthy? Why did he blatantly say Congress MPs didn't speak about NRC or CAA when everything is recorded in Saba TV. We all have seen How many times Rahul Gandhi has questioned modi and adani.. Then why instead of criticizing Modi Pinnarayi is attacking Rahul Gandhi.. This is what Rahul asked.. Why are you attacking me.. I only attack Modi.. Is this the reaosn ED doesn't question CM unlike other CMs.. Like kejriwal.. Media twisted Rahul Gandhi's words.. And you and many fell for it..,1
"There was Shashi, there was NK Premachandran, there were many others in Lok Sabha last season. Can you please explain what good they have done for the country.",1
Ohh yes.I remember him taking a clear stand on CAA stating the same would not be implemented in Kerala when few other politicians were speaking for the CAA..The one who strongly intended to close the account of BJP in legislative assembly when some are eager in giving BJP seat in Rajya Sabha n legislative assembly. Does that make any logic and sense. One person is objecting to each move and some politicians n political party is supporting RSS with its foolishness and illogical moves. We are not blind to see what is happening. We are not fools to not understand who is for and against BJP RSS.,1
"He is one of the best candidates I heard till date on this, my best wishes to you young man. India needs such young open-minded youths to represent in the parliament. Wish such candidates are there in North Indian heartlands. All the best from UP.",1
Its very good that this channel has exposed itself so early.,1
clear questions and very clear answers - Shafi will win with a huge margin,1
This guy Shafi speaks well n can be a worthy candidate to be an MP as one has to be good with words in parliament. Also I see the only candidate in Kerala after Shashi Tharoor with good English. Also I do agree with him there is something fishy between modi n pinarayi as rss say their very first enemies are communists which makes him the very first target of modi before kejriwal jow come pinarayi is untouched till now that is a bog question and rihtly said that Pinarayi is afraid of modi .To save kerala n constitution bjp shud be thrown out.,1
"Someone who is an MP from south Bangalore, his name is Tejasvi Surya, is also good in language. Unfortunately he spits venom and talks nonsense in Lok Sabha. Is that what you are pointing at. The individual intent and the parties intent and stand is what matters which needs to be strong and which should be heard in parliament.",1
Â @mohamedanas9882 we are witness of what some are doing while not taking clear stand on current issues. What can you expect from someone who cannot save the flag of a party who belongs to the minority. Why are many missing the power to question the injustice??,1
"Â @mohamedanas9882Â  what is senseless mister?? I'm talking about the intent. I am sure that you are not someone who does not know that Congress had not allowed the IUML flag in the election rallies. My question is simple, what kind of intent or strength you display for the minority when you could not protect someone's flag??shafi ot tejasvi irrespective of their political alliance or being an orator, if the intent is not good, then what is the use of being in Lok Sabha. My argument is so clear n simple. Kannadechu iruttu akkan arkum patum.",1
"Â @mohamedanas9882 3 or 50, CPIM or CPI are parties who did not take any single rupee in current electoral bond case. They are parties who have supported UPA 1 to get formed in 2004 keeping the BJP away from power. Congress is not capable of making it to the lob Sabha for next few decades since most of the politicians, ministers, CMs in Congress are going to BJP camp..all these things are true. It's because of Congress foolishness that BJP was in power for last 10 years. The left parties have better intent and vision than Congress. They could openly speak on Electoral bond and the corruption related to it while Congress cannot speak on the subject since they are beneficiaries of 2k crores.",1

5. Question whether candidate was not in LDF for most of his 20 years of political activity
6. The last question is whether he came from LDF 2 years ago
7. The question is whether the Ernakulam district candidate was nominated because a suitable candidate could not be found from Kottayam district. 
8. All this can be tolerated, but poster writing, propaganda, poster tearing, demonstration, gathering of people must be done by the Congressmen themselves.
9. Will we have to carry narys like this in the next election as well?

"No chance, NK strong in kollam",1
"Exactly.. that's how a leader, a human should speak, not belittling your opponents in every other word that you utter but highlight their fight too..

He has always been a great orator..",1
@aditikule2482 this is how rich and classy people speak,1
"Ã‚Â @Xyzambd234 I wouldn't say so..
There would be many rich people who wouldn't talk nicely.. and class is not dependent upon one's wealth in my opinion.",1
I agree very gracious of him,1
"@aditikule2482Ã‚Â 
Right, I mean, to be an Indian politician is to be rich. 
So yeah, wealth definitely doesn't have much to do here since we are talking about Indian politicians(well, tbh, politicians in general are like this, rich and not very respectful) who are rich but still don't speak as well as Mr. Tharoor.",1
Sir is so mature man see he know helthey compilation,1
That truly the class of politicians we need. Not people who are so full of hatred that they can't work together for the people.,1
Ã¢Â€Â‹@deviamma1963 - Congratulating one's opponents is a remarkable trait with or without his English.,1
That's why he is winning consecutively,1
"Yes he is winning 
But his party never wins ",1
Yes when there is no strong opposition party in India,0
@deviamma1963 his English is 100000 times better than yours.,1
What is the use from this gentleman. Let him tell from the bottom of his heart about his specific contribution to this great mother land.,1
Ã¢Â€Â‹@akashkent excellent command on language but thinking is criminal minded.he may not like the progress and prosperity of this great mother land,1
Personally being one of his admirers..True that he is an intellectual but he is of no good when it comes to connecting with the people on ground,0
He is the best politician,1
Also appreciate the corrupt feku leaders who have won. why only this gentleman.,0
Not pm. Let him continue the good work.,1
TRUE,1
I can be better PM than him,1
Good to see Suvarna news logo,1

Very happy that you have won dear Sashi Tharoor sir,1
A true humble quality leader he has.. Big congratulations to you sir,1
I was afraid as he was trailing in the early hours. Congratulations sir,0
Winning with grace and humility is something that Modi's BJP has yet to learn.,1
"I can't wait to see Rahul and Tharoor rule India together....
What a combo it will...

No matter what, I just love them.",1
"Love you tharoor sir from up

I am very happy,1
You are really very loyal.,1
Nation can't lose this guy. He was amazing,1
if it's India alliance government then he should be our foreign minister or prime minister,0
Your headphones are ok the video is left ear only,1
I'm happy for u sir ji namaste,1
Congratulations to the most articulate sensible suave politician India had ever seen and he's from my home state!,1
"Congratulations Dr. Tharoor, it would be great to have you as a leader of the opposition, we will be able to hear some nice speeches and debates in the Parliament!",1
Congratulations Sir. Sashi Tharoor for winning Election,1
A very refined and great personality person congrats sir,1
Perhaps one day we'll see him lead India in a greater position.,1
Such a wonderful leader,1
Congratulations Sashi Tharoor Sir for this wonderful victory.,1
A win indeed..!!,1
Congratulations! He is a leader of action with super vocabulary!,1
"Close call barely won 
Congratulations ",1
Congratulations Mr. Tharoor! We are so happy with this result.,1
"Politicians are all not uncouth, unrefined, uneducated.  We have a few who have a good mixture of balance and I see a man who is grounded Indian but knows the real West and their motives wooing India.",1
Awesome news,1
Such a good leader Sashi is,1
"So this means that Democracy is not dead right?
Or is it?",1
"Want you to be the Chief Minister of Kerala....Kerala and keralites all over Kerala, India and around the world will be proud of you and the Congress.",1
He is real gem feom congress.,1
He is disliked most inside his own party.. .especially by jealous Malyali Congress fellows,1
"Had the Election Commission of India not been in alliance with BJP, Congress Party would have got the majority on its own.",1
We all campaigned for Tharoorji in whatever capacity we could and we are glad the good God gave us a good result by making a fourth success for him. We wish Mr. Tharoor a very fruitful fourth term and good returns for Thiruvananthapuram. Hope he will be an exemplary Member of Parliament and do whatever he can to keep India a true democratic secular and constitutional nation against communalists!!,1
Although i support Modi's BJP but i like the Charishma of Shashi Tharoor.Lot of people might hate Modi but its hard to hate any one like Shashi ji.Definitely a great Asset of congress and should be given a bigger role,0
Good educated man,1
"he is good guy, inherently. Also chandrashekhar is also good person. Why were they put together? He could've won from another seat",1
True warrior,1
It is regretful and indigestible that communal party at last succeeded in getting one seat in vibrant Kerala. Anyway we need to accept the hard realities of democracy.,0
Shashi Tharoor ji should be in parliament as he is a great leader and our country needs him.,1
"Indian politics need a transformation, 
This is a lesson for BJP and other political parties, shouldn't beat around the bush.",0
One of the best parliamentarians,1
Tharoor unique politician. Face of India before international community.,1
"I m a bjp supporter but i love shahi tharoor very much, he is so kind hearted and such a gentle man.  Love you Shashi Tharoor.",1
"Shashi ji, congratulations 
Someone had said yesterday that u should open an English school. 
Tight slap on them.",0
"Shashi Tharoor always well spoken, A great Indian leader! He should be prime minister of India.",1
I just hope he becomes the new PM,1
Don't worry sir I am pretty sure u will be elected through rajya sabha. We need Shashi in India,1
The ONLY guy in Congress whom I genuinely respect. Hoped he would have been the leader of the opposition.,1
The most intellectual member of the parliament,1
Work harder for your constituency. The fight shouldn't have had to be this close,0
"Spokesperson for ""The Hindu"". I mean his English speaking skills.",0
Most educated leader of India,1
Better not to choose the safe passage ministers from Rajya Sabha,1
Kerala people are elected good and seasoned parliamentarian,1
He is going to work hard,0
Classic man,1
"If you are educated, you will talk like Tharoor. Gracious in victory. Rare in bjp.",1
"Waste MP, whoever voted for him is pathetic.",0
Why Congress doesn't give Tharoor a high rank in party?,0
"No matter which party he belongs to, you can't hate him! He has the guts to defend his country unlike some idiots in his party who will defame India on foreign land.",0
"Tharoor, he never wanted to win the funniest part. Congrats buddy but no use to people.",1
"The Only politician who is winning seat again just because of his english, without doing anything else for his consistency and have zero commitment for voters",1
in UPA 2 government shashi tharoor was foreign secretary of government in todays time it is known as foreign minister (Js shankar),0
"Congress got 99 seats but they are talking and acting as if they have won the election, BJP alone has more than opposition combined.",1
"A great leader, Rahul Gandhi",1
"All the best for Mr. Shashi Tharoor & Congress. ""MODI EXIT POLL"" and Manipulated stock market on 03rd June, 2024 finished.",1
"Most shameless people. Even after experiencing such water logging, drainage water system, only people of Kerala can vote for you. being malayali we are feeling shame",1
"People of this country still have a lot to suffer as they failed to eradicate bjp virus. In the coming years, unemployment will become hectic, the country will see a lot of migration, tax loot, and much worse.",0
Another 5 years of waste,0
I was expecting his defeat & win for BJP.  Kerala voters need an improvement in their thinking. It's strange that still they vote for Pappu & the Marxists & call themselves as literate.,1
Rajiv chandra sekhar was better than sasi tarur for development of Trivandrum. Sasi tarur is only a good diplomat like subramanyam swami of BJP. Both are waste.,1
"Again this incumbent politician. We all can agree he is good in debating but has done nothing for Thiruvananthapuram.
Rajiv almost won, but at the last minute Tharoor took the lead. I would have voted for Rajiv since he knows how to do business and attract business. We lost the opportunity.",1
waste bucket...,0
You feel that way because you are waste.,0
The center appointed 4 Karim cats for Swapna. Thank you Amit Shah ji,0
Very good information,1
"E course for Ravindran too. And the same is true for violin, veena & tabla",1
He should be behind bars for at least 7 years.,0
"He shall not be allowed any relief for his costs until the High Court disposes of the case
  Get rid of him",1
Aw .... the court began to understand a little,0
"He has not cooperated with the investigation, is incorrigible and crooked making the process complicated.",0
"Law should be above all, great decision by the hon. Highcourt",1
It is serious that Shivashankar does not have bail.,0
"The girlfriend, who cheated on her girlfriend by taking bribes from the chickens, has come down with a rope to get each of the chickens inside. The heroic stories of the bandits led by the head of the enlightened Kerala were enough to not make future generations nauseous and chilly.",0
"Another welcome news, Let him be there till the 2 CMs join him... along with the lady who knows all about the murky deals. Politicians know how to manage all these. It shall be the 8th wonder of this world if all those involved in this, the loot of the public money, are punished. Let justice prevail..",1
This means that the Judges are not bloody fools.,1
Could it be mental illness?,0
"Literally Kerala...When you got the chance, you killed the people of Kerala....Then the status is now...the status is gone, the status is gone...",0
"Be careful of Paranaari'S Kerala Police, who are looking after Kerala jails.",0
Tku tku tku judges.these type of most dirty people must keep life term in jail,0
"Anyone will feel fear of life, to tell the truth, he will not see his head above his neck, ED or court will not give any punishment greater than that/ so keep silent, take the punishment given and save your master.",1
If it's true. Congratulations court. Next. ...........?,1
Is Sivasankar innocent or on what basis did the innocent Swapna Suresh's life be destroyed? Appreciate the court. and ED,1
I thought it was child's play. Any killers involved in this case will be killed. Sure.,1
CM Ravindran will not be present on the 7th as he will have chest pain and will not be arrested. sure,1
Poor Shankar worked for the captain and ended up in jail,0
Sivashankaran is a fool. Pinarai is using him as a sacrificial lamb. Pinarai came up in life using and throwing away people who trusted him.... some even lost their lives for supporting him for his nefarious activities. How foolish can people especially party members can become.,1
The dream game will not happen,0
